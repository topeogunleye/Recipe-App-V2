      <p>
        Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve
        our Services and to enable our users to enjoy, use, and easily navigate
        our Services. To provide you with a consistent user experience and to
        recognize you as a user across our Services, we may collect and combine
        data as described below; for example, data collected when you visit the
        Site or the App from one browser or device may be combined or linked
        with data collected when you visit the Site or App from a different
        browser or device, which may also be combined or linked with product
        usage data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, we collect two types of information: Personal Data and Other
        Information. &quot;
        <strong>Personal Data</strong>
        &quot; is information that can be used to identify or is reasonably
        linkable to you as an individual, and may include Usage Information (as
        defined below). &quot;
        <strong>Other Information</strong>
        &quot; is information that is not linkable to you as an identifiable
        individual, including information that has been de-identified or
        aggregated with data from other users.

        <li>
          Product, ownership, and service information about your kitchen
          appliances and accessories, including those that are manufactured by
          Recipa as well as any that are capable of working with the Recipa app
          (for example, if you use the App to remotely control a kitchen
          appliance, we will collect information from the appliance manufacturer
          that we need to make the App work);
        </li>
        <li>
          Information you voluntarily provide about yourself, such as allergies,

          purchase;
        </li>
        <li>
          Your preferences, such as product wish lists, food and recipe

          provide so that we can help you manage your grocery inventory (such as
          photographs or video you provide to facilitate ingredient recognition
          features);
        </li>
        <li>Your Usage Information, as described further below; and</li>

        Recipa keeps your Personal Data, see Section 3, Data Retention.

      <p>
        Many of our services and features require some Personal Data. If you
        choose not to provide the necessary Personal Data, you may not be able
        to use certain services or features. If you choose not to share your
        Personal Data, features that require personalization will not work for
        you.

        Other parties may provide us with Personal Data. For example, if you
        create a Recipa account using your login from an other party’s service
        (including a social media network such as Facebook), we will access and
        collect the information about you that your privacy settings on that
        service permit so that we can create an account for you. Also, we may
        collect information that you make available to Temitope or other
        manufacturers of kitchen appliances and accessories (like information
        about your appliance to allow us to send cooking times and temperatures
        to the appliance) if this is related to providing the Services to you.

        {' '}
        We use your Personal Data to provide our Services and administer your
        inquiries. For example, when you create an account through the Services
        and become a Registered User or when you choose to create your own
        profile, we may ask you for Personal Data so we can create your account
        or populate your profile (see &quot;
        <strong>Registered Users</strong>
        &quot;). below). We may also use your Personal Data to update our
        Services or features, troubleshoot, protect our Sites, Apps, and users,
        or provide support to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use your Personal Data to improve and develop our products and
        services, personalize our products, make recommendations to you, and
        send you relevant offers. We may also use your Personal Data to send you
        Recipa newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, or other
        information that may be of interest to you. Where required by applicable
        law, we will obtain your consent to send you these communications. If
        you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive them, please
        follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the
        communications or update your user preferences information.

        {' '}
        Once you become a Registered User, you will be able to create a profile
        page by submitting certain Personal Data. The profile page may be
        viewable by other Recipa users and will display your profile name as
        well as your profile picture, if you choose to upload one or agree to
        allow a Third-party service (like Facebook) to provide one for you. You
        can choose what other Personal Data you provide as part of your profile.
        Providing such information is voluntary and should correlate with the
        degree of interaction you want to have with Recipa and its users.

        However, where Other Information is taken alone or combined only with
        other non-identifying information, it will not be treated as Personal
        Data. We may use Other Information for any purpose, unless prohibited by
        law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may combine your Personal Data with Other Information and aggregate
        it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you
        with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the
        Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used. We may

        {' '}
        When you visit or use the Services or use a Recipa website or mobile
        application that has Recipa features (like the Yum button), our servers
        automatically record information that your browser or mobile device
        sends or transmits (&quot;
        <strong>Usage Information</strong>
        &quot;). This Usage Information may include information such as your
        computer&apos;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type or the
        webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site
        or the App that you visit (or of the site you visited that had the
        Recipa feature), the time spent on those pages, information you search

        mobile device, user settings, location (if you enable this feature), and
        statistics and information about your use of the Site and App. We use
        this information to provide and improve the Services, develop new
        products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to
        you. We also use Usage Information to monitor and analyze use of the
        Services, for technical administration, to secure the Site and App and
        protect those who visit the Site or App, to improve functionality and
        user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our
        visitors&apos; needs. For example, some of this information is collected
        so that when you revisit the Services, we will recognize you and can
        serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your
        interests. Some of the Usage Information (like your IP address) is
        treated as Personal Data.

        {' '}
        Like many websites, we use cookies, pixels, web beacons, APIs and
        similar technologies to collect Usage Information. Pixels and web
        beacons are small pieces of code placed on web pages and content that
        communicate when the page or content has been viewed. A cookie is a
        small data file that your browser places on your computer that helps us
        understand how you interact with the Site and use our Services. We use
        two types of cookies. We use persistent cookies to save information like
        your search preferences, your account settings and login information, so
        that we can remember you and your settings when you return to the Site
        or App, and personalize your experience. We use session cookies to
        enable certain features of our Services, but unlike persistent cookies,
        session cookies are deleted when you leave or log off and/or when you
        close your browser. Third-party advertisers on the Site or in the App
        may also place or read cookies on your browser. Most Internet browsers
        automatically accept cookies but you can instruct your browser, by
        changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before

        deliver us relevant metrics and information. The collection of this data
        by these other parties is subject to their own privacy notices.

        Below is an explanation of the different legal grounds we have for
        processing your Personal Data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>To satisfy our contractual obligations to you.</strong>
          {' '}
          For
          example: allowing you to register for an account; providing the
          Services to you; assisting you with pairing a kitchen appliance or
          accessory through the Services; and fulfilling your product orders and
          providing additional services (for example, delivery, after-sale
          services, and the management of returns).

          information, such as information about your allergies, so that we can

          prize promotion/competition; sending you customized marketing
          communications related to our products and services electronically
          (including email, notifications from other party’s services, and
          notifications from mobile applications); and sharing your Personal
          Data with our selected trusted partners to help us send customized
          marketing communications with your consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When we have a legitimate business interest to do so.</strong>
          {' '}
          For example: managing the requests for information you send us,
          including handling complaints; preventing fraud; enforcing our rights
          before the courts; improving the performance and security of our
          products and our Services, including the App and the Site; sending you
          customer care communications concerning products or services you have
          used or which you showed interest in, and in order to carry out
          customer satisfaction surveys; unless you opt-out, contacting you for
          marketing purposes by phone (non-automated) and via paper mail; and
          carrying out activities useful for the transfers of business and
          business branches, takeovers, mergers, demergers or other
          transformations and for the execution of such transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For legal obligations.</strong>
          We may also use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply
          with our legal obligations.
        </li>
      </ul>

        If you do not want Recipa to use your electronic contact details for
        marketing purposes, you can always follow the instructions to &quot;
        <strong>unsubscribe</strong>

          be informed on the purposes and methods of the processing of your
          Personal Data;

          ask for access to your Personal Data (commonly known as making a &lquot;
          <strong>data subject access request</strong>
          &rquot;). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold
          about you;

          ask for updating or rectification of the Personal Data we hold about

          the new data you provide to us;

        <li>
          request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to
          delete or remove your Personal Data where there is no good reason for

          your Personal Data where you have successfully objected to processing
          or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with
          local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
          with your request of erasure for reasons which will be communicated to
          you, if applicable, at the time of your request;

          restrict the processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask
          us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following
          scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data&apos;s accuracy; (b)
          where you allege that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not
          want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we
          no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
          legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we
          need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use
          it;
        </li>
        <li>
          object to the processing, wholly or partly, of your Personal Data
          where we are relying on legitimate interest (or those of a third
          party) and there is something about your particular situation which
          makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it
          impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may
          demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
          information which override your rights and freedoms;

      <h2 id="security">9. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Recipa is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ
        administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect
        your information from unauthorized access; however, despite these
        efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method
        of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other
        type of misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer
        secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you
        might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us
        of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the
        {' '}

      <h2 id="other-sites">10. Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our Services may contain links to other websites, apps, and platforms.
        If you click on an ad or another third party link, you will be directed
        to that third party&apos;s website, app, or platform. The fact that we link
        to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is
        not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation
        with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or
        information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control
        over third party websites. These other websites may place their own
        cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit
        Personal Data from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the
        use or disclosure of the Personal Data you submit to them. We encourage
        you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you
        visit. This Privacy Notice does not address, and we are not responsible
        for, the privacy, information or other practices of any other parties.
      </p>
      <h2 id="children">11. Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service is not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect
        personally identifiable information from children under 16. If we become
        aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 16 (or any
        other age specified by applicable law), we will take steps to delete
        such information from our files as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <h2 id="updates">12. Amendments and Updates</h2>
      <p>
        We may occasionally update this Privacy Notice. Please review the
        Effective Date at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Notice
        was last revised. If we make any material changes we will notify you as
        required by law, which may include by email (sent to the email address
        specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior
        to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically
        review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
