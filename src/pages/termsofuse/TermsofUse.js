          In order to access, use or receive certain Services, you may register
          and create an account (<strong>Account</strong>) and become a{' '}
          <strong>Registered User</strong> by either registering through our
          Site or Application or by using your account with a third party social
          network website, like Facebook (a <strong>Social Network Site</strong>

          form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving
          services under the laws of the United States or other applicable
          jurisdiction. When creating an Account, you will be required to
          provide certain personal information about yourself and establish a
          username and a password. You will also have the option of providing
          certain personal information about other people in your household so
          that we may link to them to your Account, or so you can otherwise
          represent them through your Account. We reserve the right to suspend
          or terminate your Account if any information provided during the
          registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, false or
          misleading.
        </p>
        <h3>Passwords</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for safeguarding your password that you use for
          your Account and for any activities or actions under your Account or
          with your Smart Products, whether or not you have authorized such
          activities or actions. Recipa is not liable for any loss or damage
          arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to provide you with certain Services, you have the option of
          logging in to Recipa using your username/login and password to various
          Social Network Sites or other online sites and accounts that you wish
          to link with your Account. If you decide to log in using one of these
          other accounts, you grant Recipa permission to access these accounts
          solely to the extent necessary to provide these Services. You may also
          link your accounts on other Social Network Sites or other online sites
          to your Recipa Account in order for Recipa to provide certain
          Services. If you link accounts, you grant Recipa permission to store
          information (such as your social account usernames) to the extent
          necessary to provide the Services.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Any personal information that you provide to Recipa is subject to our{' '}
          <a href="/privacy">Privacy Notice</a>, which governs our collection
          and use of your personal information. As part of providing you the
          Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such
          as service announcements and administrative messages. These
          communications are considered part of the Services and your Account,
          which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.
        </p>
        <h3>Features To Help Manage Ingredients And Cooking</h3>
        <p>
          Recipa may offer features to help you manage ingredients and cooking,
          such as ingredient recognition, voice recognition, calendar planning,
          and guided recipe features. When offered, these features are intended
          to be a convenience for you, but always check the results before
          relying on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are always trying to improve the range of ingredients and accuracy
          of our ingredient recognition methods. But our methods may be unable
          to detect certain ingredients, and may sometimes incorrectly identify
          ingredients. Check the results — especially if you have any eating
          restrictions or allergies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guided recipe features may be available on select recipes, and allow
          you to follow recipe instructions using on-screen prompts. If you have
          a compatible, connected appliance, some of these recipes may also
          enable you to remotely control your appliance as you follow the
          instructions. You may be required to connect or configure your
          appliance to enable the remote control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our guided recipes are designed to result in dishes that are properly
          cooked, and we hope your dishes come out just right. But cooking
          results can vary based on the specifics of your kitchen, your
          ingredients, your cooking utensils, and your appliances. As with any
          recipe, you may need to adjust your cooking approach or cooking times.
          Always check your food for doneness before consumption. Consuming
          undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish, or eggs may result in
          illness.
        </p>
        <p>
          When controlling your connected appliance remotely through Recipa, you
          should confirm that instructions are being properly transmitted to
          your appliance. You should also monitor your appliance throughout the
          cooking process.
        </p>
        <p>
          All features of the Services, including ingredient and cooking
          features, are subject to change or removal at any time, without
          notice.
        </p>
        <h2>Smart Products And Smart Product Purchases</h2>
        <h3>Smart Products</h3>
        <p>
          Our Smart Products connect to our Applications to help you manage your
          cooking. To connect your Smart Product, download an Application, which
          will guide you through the steps to set up connect your Smart Product.
          If you have problems or questions, please contact us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide the Smart Products as a convenience, and we hope they make
          things easier for you. You agree to always use the Smart Products
          responsibly, and use proper care, good judgment, and common sense. In
          particular:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Always follow your Smart Product's instructions, Use &amp; Care
            Guide, Quick Reference Guide, or other documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            When cooking, always follow recommended guidelines (such as from
            your country's food authorities), and be sure to check your food for
            doneness before eating. Consuming undercooked foods (such as meats,
            poultry, seafood, or eggs) may result in illness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use caution around heat, including when using Smart Products that
            get hot during normal product usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirm that your Smart Product is properly charged and operational,
            and that your Application and Smart Product are communicating.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not rely on the Smart Products or any of the Services to prevent
            accidents, damage, fire, injury, or other hazards.{' '}

        <h3>Product Availability and Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          We use reasonable efforts to fulfill orders, but cannot guarantee
          availability of any particular product or service, and sometimes an
          item shown for sale through the Services may not be available. In that
          case, we may cancel your order or contact you for follow-up. We
          reserve the right to discontinue the sale of any product or service at
          any time without notice. We may decline or place quantity limits on
          your order at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of a pricing or other error, we reserve the right to
          revoke offers, cancel orders and correct errors or omissions,
          including after an order has been placed. Our acknowledgement of an
          order means that your order request has been received; not that the
          price or availability of an item has been confirmed. "MSRP" prices are
          the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, which may differ from the
          other online or retailer prices in your area. In some cases,
          intermediate markdowns may have been taken.
        </p>
        <h3>Purchases</h3>
        <p>
          If you wish to purchase products or services described on the
          Platform, you will be asked to supply certain information applicable
          to your purchase, including credit card and shipping information. You
          may be able to store your information with your account, which allows
          you to make future purchases without re-entering information. You
          agree to pay all charges incurred by you and your credit card (or
          other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when
          such charges are incurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are required by law to collect all applicable sales taxes for all
          states and municipalities. You authorize us to charge the applicable
          sales taxes to your credit card at the time of completion of order
          shipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We accept all major credit cards: VISA, MasterCard, American Express
          and Discover. For your security, the billing name and address on your
          credit card must match that of the information you submit. If the
          information provided does not match, your order may be delayed in
          processing. We reserve the right to cancel any order that does not
          adhere to these criteria. We may preauthorize your order amount with
          your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order,
          which may have an effect on your available credit line.
        </p>
        <p>
          All billing and registration information provided by you must be
          accurate, complete and correct. By confirming your purchase at the end
          of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the items,
          products and / or services that you have requested. Receiving an order
          acknowledgement via email does not guarantee the acceptance of an
          order.
        </p>
        <h3>Limitations on Purchases</h3>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for failure to fulfill orders due to causes
          beyond our control. We reserve the right to: (1) limit order
          quantities to reasonable amounts (in our sole discretion); (2)
          prohibit purchases on the Platform by retailers, distributors, or
          resellers; (3) discontinue or refuse to offer any product or service;
          (4) impose conditions on any discount, coupon or promotion; and/or (5)
          bar any user from completing a transaction.
        </p>
        <h3>Shipping, Delivery</h3>
        <p>
          We ship using FedEx or UPS. Shipping normally takes between 4 to 10
          business days, but may take longer for outlying areas. Your cart at
          checkout will itemize any additional shipping fees.

          or a resident or a national of, any country subject to a government
          embargo or other restriction, or that has been designated by any

            <p>
              A Recipa subscription is an{' '}
              <strong>automatically renewing</strong> premium paid subscription
              feature on the Recipa Application and Site that provides home
              cooks with enhanced features not available to other Recipa users,
              including (for example) video recipe instruction and inspiration
              from influential chefs and advanced meal planning capabilities. We
              may add or remove features from Recipa subscription plans from
              time to time. Accessing Recipa subscription-only features requires
              an auto-renewing subscription, but the general Recipa platform
              (available via the Application and Site) remains free to use.
            </p>
            <h4>Automatic Renewal of Recipa Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
              You may purchase access to a Recipa subscription for a specified
              fee, and your subscription will automatically renew every month
              until you cancel. We will automatically charge the associated fee
              (plus any applicable taxes) to your credit card or other payment
              method in your Recipa Account each month unless you cancel your
              Recipa subscription as described below.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid being billed for the next month's fee, you must cancel
              your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current
              monthly subscription period. To cancel your subscription, or to
              see your next renewal date or the current fee for your
              subscription, visit your{' '}
              <a href="/settings" target="_blank">
                Recipa Settings

              page.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you cancel your Recipa subscription, your access will end on
              the last day of your monthly subscription period. To access
              Recipa's subscriber-only features after you cancel your
              subscription, you will need to purchase a new subscription, at
              which time different fees, terms, and conditions may apply.
            </p>
            <h4>Free Trial and Promotional Offers for Recipa Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
              We may offer promotional or free trial offers that provide access
              to subscriber-only features for a short period of time at a
              discounted fee, as described in connection with each offer.
              Additional terms may apply to promotional or free trial offers. If
              you sign up for a free trial or promotional offer, your
              subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription
              unless you cancel before the end of the trial or promotional
              period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eligibility for a free trial or promotional offer will be
              determined by Recipa, in our sole discretion. We may limit the
              eligibility or duration of free trial or promotional offers at any
              time and for any reason. We reserve the right to revoke any offer
              and put your Account on hold if we determine that you are not
              eligible for the offer.
            </p>
            <h4>Recipa Subscription Plans</h4>
            <p>
              We may offer various types of subscriptions or access to Recipa's
              subscriber-only features. Some subscription plans may have
              different terms, conditions or limitations that will be disclosed
              in connection with those plans. You can find information regarding
              your Recipa subscription on the{' '}

            </p>
            <h4>Payment for Recipa Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
              You must maintain accurate and up-to-date credit card or other
              payment information in your Account. You authorize us to charge
              any credit card or other payment method associated with your
              Account. If a payment is unsuccessful, we may suspend your access
              to Recipa subscriber-only until you provide a valid payment
              method. Recipa assumes no responsibility or liability if your
              subscription fails to renew or expires because of invalid payment
              information. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: To process your payment for Recipa subscriptions, we use
              Stripe as our payment processor for the Site and Apple (for iOS)
              and Google (for Android) as our payment processors for the
              Applications. Accordingly, we will transfer certain billing and
              payment information to these entities, in accordance with our{' '}
              <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">
                Privacy Notice
              </a>
              . You may also be subject to Terms of Use and Privacy Policies
              made available by these entities.
            </p>
            <h4>Cancellation of Recipa Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
              To cancel your Recipa subscription, go to your{' '}
              <a href="/settings" target="_blank">
                Recipa Settings
              </a>{' '}
              on the Recipa Site or Application and follow the instructions for
              cancellation. You may cancel your Recipa subscription at any time;
              you will continue to have access to subscriber-only features
              through the end of your current monthly billing period.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you signed up for your Recipa subscription through an App
              Provider (such as the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store)
              and you want to cancel your subscription, you will need to cancel
              through that App Provider — for example by visiting your account
              with the applicable App Provider and turning off the "automatic
              renewal" option. Your App Provider may also provide additional
              billing information about the Recipa subscription through your
              account with that App Provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you cancel your Recipa subscription, you will still have access
              to the free content on your Recipa Account.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may terminate, restrict, or suspend your access to your Recipa
              subscription without credit or refund to you for any reason in our
              sole discretion, including if we determine that your activity
              violates these Terms, is improper, involves fraud or misuse, or
              harms or interferes with our or any other person's interests.
            </p>
            <h4>Content or Feature Changes to Recipa Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
              We want to keep content and features you love available through
              our Recipa subscription, but there are a variety of reasons why
              certain Content or features might need to be changed or removed.
              All Recipa subscriber-only Content and features are subject to
              change or removal at any time without notice. Content removal does
              not entitle you to a refund (full or partial) of subscription
              fees.
            </p>
            <h4>Refunds for Recipa Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
              Subscription fees for Recipa are <u>nonrefundable</u>, except
              where prohibited by applicable law. If you cancel, you will not
              receive a refund or credit for any partial-month access to your
              Recipa subscription.
            </p>
            <h4>Deleting Your Recipa Account</h4>
            <p>
              If you want to delete your Recipa Account, you may be required to
              cancel your Recipa subscription before your Account can be
              deleted. Simply deleting the Recipa Application from your device
              will not result in your being unsubscribed from Recipa subscriber
              features.
            </p>
            <h4>Eligibility and Use Restrictions for Recipa Subscriptions</h4>

              To subscribe to Recipa, you must be a U.S. resident, at least 18
              years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction. You are
              permitted to use Recipa subscriber-only features for personal,
              non-commercial uses only and may not share Recipa subscription
              features with individuals beyond your household. You may download
              recipes, ingredient lists, and cooking instructions for personal
              use, but Recipa subscription video Content is for streaming use
              only and may not be downloaded to any devices. You agree not to
              circumvent, remove, alter, or thwart any Content protections in
              the Recipa Application or Site.
            </p>
            <h4>Sponsored Content &amp; Advertising in Recipa Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
              We want you to know that certain Content available in your Recipa
              subscription may be sponsored by a third-party advertiser, or may
              contain third-party advertising. Recipa may also promote and
              advertise its own products or services through Recipa
              subscriptions. In addition, the personalities or chefs that are
              featured in Recipa subscription Content might be incentivized to
              encourage users to sign up for Recipa and to visit their Recipa
              subscriber Content.

          tort, property, or equitable claims arising out of, relating to, or in

          these Terms (including any claims relating to the validity, scope,
          interpretation, breach or enforceability of these Terms) (all of which

          You agree that you will assert any Claim against Recipa and/or the

          between the terms of this Arbitration provision and the AAA Rules the
          provisions of this provision shall apply. The AAA Rules, forms and
          information are available online at{' '}

        <p>
          In the event that any provision of this Arbitration provision or the
          Class Action Waiver provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable
          in a particular case or jurisdiction, that provision will be severable
          in that case or jurisdiction, as the case may be, without affecting
          the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the
          Agreement, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the
          Agreement in other cases and jurisdictions.

          reimburse us in whole or in part for any of the amount that we pay if

          bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes within
          that court's jurisdiction.
